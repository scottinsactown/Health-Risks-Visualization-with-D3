# Health Risks Visualization with D3
https://scottinsactown.github.io/Health-Risks-Visualization-with-D3/

Web-based interactive scatterplot that allows to a user to select any combination of one of three demographic factors and one of three health risk factors. Visualization smoothly transforms when user selects different factors. Tooltips included for each circle, which also update when factors are changed. As a Californian, I also highlighted CA's circle on the plot for easier identification. Chart is made responsive to adapt to different devices and browser sizes. 

Tools used: JavaScript, D3, HTML, CSS
